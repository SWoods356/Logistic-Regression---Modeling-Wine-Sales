# Logistic-Regression---Modeling-Wine-Sales

## Summary
This notebook features EDA and logistic regression on a dataset containing chemical properties and 
ratings for around 12,000 commercially available wines.

## Modeling
This notebook attempts to model the 'target' variable, measuring how many cases of wine are sold. Linear regression, logistic regression, and hurdle regression methods are employed.

Logistic Regression Model Results: Achieved the best (lowest) RMSE score of my class (Supervised Learning) in predicting the probability of a wine being sold:
